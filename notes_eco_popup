// HOW TO BE ECO FRIENDLY WHILE COOKING PASTA
//1. YOU ONLY NEED ONE LITRE OF WATER FOR 100GR OF PASTA. THIS MEANS ROUGHLY 4 cups or  2 PINTS OF BEER or around 3 cans of coke
//2. COVER THE POT OF WATER WITH A LID SO THE WATER TAKES LESS TIME TO REACH THE BOILING POINT. ( science does a magic trick and heat doesn't spread everywhere but instead it stays in house and voil√†. save 3 minutes today, 3 minutes tomorrow and in one year of pasta cooking, you'll save 1095 minutes and feel much better about yourself)
//3. TURN OFF THE STOVE ONCE YOU REACH HALF OF THE COOKING TIME (BY COVERING THE POT YOU SAVE THE HEAT INSIDE THE POT AND THE PASTA KEEPS COOKING, see? everything is connected, it's like a conspiration or something
//EXTRA POINTS FOR THE TRUE ECO WARRIORS
//4. KEEP IT LOCAL AND FRESH. WE ALL KNOW IT TAKES MORE EFFORT, BUT HEY, GOING TO THE FARMERS MARKET MAKES FOR GREAT STORIES.
//5. GET A WATER FILTER! LET'S FACE IT, ALL THESE WATER BOTTLES ARE DAMN HEAVY AND A PAIN IN THE ASS TO CARRY, BUY A FILTER AND YOU'LL HAVE CLEAN WATER ON TAP. SAVE SOME MONEY AND BE RESPONSABILE? YOUR MOM IS GONNA BE SO PROUD!
